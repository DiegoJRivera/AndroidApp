# AndroidApp

This mobile application consists of a logical game that starts with a 4x4 grid. Most of the cells in the grid are greyed, with four cells set randomly two different colours each pair.

The aim is to remove the greyed squares and replace them with either colour â€“ each time a user taps on a grey cell it will change to the first colour and then automatically set to the next colour for the next tap. Alternatively, the user can be given the choice of which colour to choose. To win the game you have to make sure there are NO more than 2 squares of the same colour next to each other, either horizontally or vertically.

Other features of the mobile application are:

  - Ability to change the colours of the cells.
  - Include a setting for the user to change the complexity of the grid from 4x4 (rows, columns) to a 5x5 or a 6x6 grid.
  - Include an option for the user to set the difficulty level based on the remaining time to complete the game.
  - Saving the best times (scores).
